**Aim and Scope**

Optimization problems widely exist in many economic, scientific and engineering applications. Evolutionary optimization algorithms have been extensively studied and achieved remarkable results in the fields of mathematics, operations research and computer science. A common implicit assumption in most existing optimization methods is that all resources for an optimization task are available and stored on a single device. Unfortunately, the assumption is violated in many applications with the growing storage of personal data and computational power of edge devices. Furthermore, jointly addressing optimization tasks among multiple edge devices with distributed data raises concerns about data security, privacy protection and fairness. As a result, it is crucial to develop new privacy preserving and fairness aware optimization paradigms to leverage the power of distributed computing and storage. 

Over the past years, federated learning has become a popular machine learning paradigm that can leverage distributed data without leaking sensitive information. This is achieved by constructing a global model by aggregating local models separately trained on different devices/clients using local data. In contrast to federated learning, privacy preserving optimization has received much less attention. For data-driven optimization, it could be affected by data or algorithmic bias and thus generate unfair results: when the objective function values are correlated with real-world rewards (e.g., money), parties may be hesitant to collaborate if they risk incurring smaller real-world rewards than others. Hence, addressing the potential unfairness problems in optimization is also vital for building a positive and sustainable ecosystem, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving and fairness-aware optimization techniques.

**Organization & Schedule**

This half-day workshop will consist of two invited speeches (30 minutes each), six regular oral presentations (15 minutes each + 5 minutes discussion), and a 10-minute conclusion session. The free discussion will provide the opportunity for all participants to ask questions and engage in an interactive discussion with the expert, focusing on identifying key challenges, potential collaborations, and future research directions in the field. After the discussion, the workshop organizers will summarize the key takeaways from the workshop, highlighting important insights, research trends, and potential opportunities that emerged during the discussions.
